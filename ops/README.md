# Operations policy tools

`simplestchat-ops` currently validates one local release manifest. It has no
network, engine, service, SSH or deployment command. Python remains the release
runtime and the reference implementation.

```sh
cargo run --locked -q -p simplestchat-ops -- release manifest --path /path/to/release.json
cargo test --locked -p simplestchat-ops
```

The successful diagnostic JSON contains `manifest`, `manifestBytes` and
`manifestSha256`. The digest and byte count describe the original file, including
its whitespace, BOM and encoding. The semantic projection preserves the existing
seven field names; it must never replace bytes covered by release hashes. This
command does not authenticate an archive or signature and does not authorize a
release. Validation failure returns exit 1 and the fixed JSON
`{"passed":false,"failure":"invalid_release_manifest"}`. Invalid arguments return
exit 2 and the usage line; no path or file contents enter error output.

Inputs must be nonempty regular files of at most 1 MiB. The descriptor reader
refuses symlinks in every path component, parent (`..`) components and more than
256 components. It retains directory descriptors, checks file identity, size,
permissions and modification/change timestamps against both the open file and
visible binding, and closes all successful reads explicitly. This is a snapshot,
not a lock against later writes. Use the retained original bytes for a later
transaction, or reopen and verify the digest at its operation boundary.

The parser matches Python's UTF-8/16/32 BOM and null-pattern detection and keeps
integer tokens distinct from floats and booleans. It rejects decoded duplicate
keys at every depth, nonfinite numbers and unknown manifest fields. JSON is
limited to 128 nested containers and 100,000 values, with at most 2 MiB of decoded
UTF-8. Unpaired surrogates are refused. These are explicit bounded-decoder limits,
not a claim to accept every value Python can represent. Calendar checks use the
locked Unicode 16 decimal-digit data, matching the pinned Python oracle; original
timestamp text remains unchanged.

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.rs` | The single allowlisted CLI form and fixed output failures |
| `src/json.rs` | Serde grammar, duplicate keys, numeric tokens and bounded decoding |
| `src/files.rs` | Descriptor-bound regular-file snapshot and change detection |
| `src/release/manifest.rs` | Existing release schema, migration checksums and real UTC dates |

The crate uses existing dependency versions and does not depend on the server,
load generator, mediasoup or native TLS. The manual argument parser follows
`xtask` for this one command and avoids adding a CLI framework dependency.

No binary is installed by Ansible or added to the production image. Host
execution requires a separate attested operations artifact, an inspected static
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build, harmless CLI checks on Debian 13, and
controller-side verification before any installed binary executes. Static CRT
selection alone does not prove the final binary's dependencies; inspect the
result as the [Rust linkage reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes)
recommends. The existing signed server artifact and its ten-file contract stay
unchanged. Python's controller-supplied preflight remains the bootstrap trust
boundary until binary provenance, ABI and installation ownership are established.
